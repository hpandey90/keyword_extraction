# keyword_extraction
Data Science has provided us with many new opportunities and pathways to tackle problems. One such problem is to identify tags and keywords in questions and answers posted on websites like stackoverflow and quora, to name a few. Due to technological advancement, the number of question answer websites and visits to sites have increased manifold. Stackoverflow registers over 8 million visitors every day, whereas Quora register something between 30 to 40 million visitors every day. And, due to a huge amount of question and answers being posted on these websites every day it is manually impossible to tag each question based on certain topics unless users have specified them explicitly and correctly. We will try to address this challenge of tagging questions through our project. One more use of keyword extraction is that it segregates the questions based on certain keywords which gets helpful while searching for a question on a topic. Our goal will be to apply data science principles that we learnt in our course to extract these keywords and tags on the questions posted.
